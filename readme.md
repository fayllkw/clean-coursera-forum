## cleanTeachOuts
A mini project for cleaning the Coursera discussion forums data. It mainly:
* restores the broken format
* removes HTML tags
* adds post length information
* merges questions and answers
* adds post language information

Data are not included, as I'm not allowed to share it online, but they are just standard discussion forum data that one can get from Coursera.

One can run cleaningMain.py if they have data of serveral courses. Or run one of the other python scripts if only intermediate results are needed. Check each file to see what its effect is. Remember to change the settings, so that you have correct path information to your data.
